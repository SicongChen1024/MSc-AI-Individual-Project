# MSc-AI-Individual-Project
This repositry contains code to produce results in my MSc AI Individual project: Defending Against Adversarial Attacks on Perceptual Ad-blockers

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Adversarial Training
Run main.py in Adversarial training to derive a sample SqueezeNet model with adversarial training
## Jacobian Regularization
Run main.py in Jacobian regularization to derive a sample SqueezeNet model with Jacobian regularization
## Ensemble Ad-blockers
Run main.py in multiple models to derive the results of conducting randomized and ensemble&randomized algorithms
